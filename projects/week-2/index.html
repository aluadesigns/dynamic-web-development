            Almaty is the largest city in Kazakhstan, located in the southeast part of the country. It was formerly the capital and lies in the northern foothills of the Trans-Ili Alatau at an elevation of 700–900 meters, where the Big Almaty and Small Almaty rivers emerge onto the plain.</div>

                <div id="aport-text">Aport apples come from Almaty, nestled alongside the Trans-lli Alatau mountains. The name of the city translates to grandfather of apples because the fruit was such a defining part of the town. During the Soviet Era, these apples were grown in orchards around the city.</div>

The canyon follows the Charyn river for about 50 kilometers. The walls of the canyon reach up to 300 meters at some point and the colours range from red to brown, yellow and black.

Over the course of time, rainfall filled the area, submerging the forest of spruce trees and forming 1,300-foot (400-meter) long Kaindy Lake. </div>
